# ToDo App
This is a todo app made using React JS. It focuses on using a webpack, getting familiar with React basics and routing.

# How to use these files
You'd need NPM. No external server needed - host it on a webpack. The server I used was 1234, you can change it in the webpack config file situated in the root folder.
